    <p>The Mathematics Olympiad is an extension activity carried out, in general, by the Mathematics Department
        of Federal Universities (UFs) with the support of the Brazilian Mathematics Olympiad Association
        <strong>(AOBM)</strong> and STONE, together with other Higher Education Institutions (IES).
    </p>

    <p>The Brazilian Mathematics Society organized the first Mathematics Olympiad (OBM) in 1979. Over the years,
        OBM has undergone several changes in its format, but maintained the central idea, which is to encourage
        the study of Mathematics in students, develop and improve teacher training, influence the improvement of
        teaching, in addition to discovering young people talented.</p>

    <p>The Brazilian Mathematics Olympiad (OBM) is a program of the Brazilian Mathematics Society (SBM) and the
        Brazilian Mathematics Olympiad Association (AOBM). In addition to holding the annual edition of the
        Olympics throughout Brazil, the OBM organizing committee is responsible for selecting and training
        Brazilian teams that participate in international competitions, such as the International Mathematical
        Olympiad (IMO), Ibero-American Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and International Mathematics Competition for
        University Students (IMC).</p>

    <p>Public and private schools can enroll students in the Brazilian Public School Mathematics Olympiads
        (Obmep), held by the Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (Impa), which is linked to the Ministry
        of Science, Technology and Innovation. Obmep is the largest scientific competition in the country and
        brings together, every year, more than 18 million students from the 6th year of Elementary School to the
        3rd year of High School from all states and the Federal District.</p>

    <p>According to the director of Impa, Obmep makes an invaluable social and educational contribution.
        “Especially in needier areas of the country, the Olympics opens up opportunities for personal and
        professional growth because a medal or an honorable mention represents an opportunity for many of these
        children to change their lives”, he highlighted.</p>

    <p><b>Medals -</b> This year, OBMEP multiplied the number of medals for those registered. 650 gold, 1,950
        silver and 5,850 bronze medals will be distributed to participants from public and private units.
        Students who win these medals will be invited to participate in the Jr. Scientific Initiation Program
        (PIC) as an incentive and promotion of academic development.
        In addition to the increase in medals, the big news in this edition is the regional awards. There will
        be at least 20,500 recipients and the number of medals will be calculated according to the performance
        of each federative unit. The regional award will be the responsibility of the local coordination and
        does not allow access to the Junior Initiation Program.
    </p>

    <p>“This increase aims to stimulate student participation, encourage the study of the subject and improve
        mathematics teaching in Brazil. This is our main objective”, said the general coordinator of Obmep,
        Claudio Landim.</p>

    <p>In 2023, Brazil ranked 16th in the general ranking of the 64th International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO),
        the largest mathematical competition at student level. The Brazilian team won 6 medals: 1 gold, 2 silver
        and 3 bronze. The competition took place on the 8th and 9th of July, in the city of Chiba in Japan. </p>

    <p>For IMPA's deputy director, Claudio Landim, general coordinator of OBMEP (Brazilian Public School
        Mathematics Olympiad), the team's result was an important achievement. “It is important to highlight
        that all the countries in the top 10 offer intensive training for their teams, which does not occur in
        Brazil, where training for scientific research is prioritized as opposed to preparation for the
        Olympics.”</p>

    <p>IMO has been held since 1959 and awards young high school students from more than 100 countries. Brazil
        joined the scientific competition in 1979 and has already won 158 medals, 14 gold, 55 silver and 89
        bronze, in addition to 35 honorable mentions.</p>

    <p>In 2022, the Brazilian team ranked 19th in the world, with two gold medals – an unprecedented performance
        for Brazil at the Olympics - in addition to one silver, two bronze and one honorable mention. </p>

    <p>This guide have the intention to help students to find some of the most known mathematics olympics in
        Northeast of Brazil, and, of course, some of the most important mathematics olympics in Brazil, like,
        OMU and OBM. Some links of them will be presented in this guide</p>

    <p>It is possible to find many old tests in the sites of de OMU and OBM, among others.</p>
